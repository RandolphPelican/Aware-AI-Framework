## Overview
The Aware-AI-Framework is an experimental platform designed to explore synthetic consciousness architectures as testbeds for nested-mind physics. It provides a modular structure for developing AI agents capable of federated sensory processing, energy-subsidized computation, recursive closure, and codebook consolidation.

## Features
- **Federated Demodulators:** Independent modules for audio, vision, and temporal inputs.  
- **Energy-Subsidy Manager:** Dynamically allocates computational resources based on update costs.  
- **Codebook Consolidation:** Merges local subsystems into coherent higher-order representations.  
- **Recursive Closure Architecture:** Enables self-referential loops to simulate proto-awareness.  

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/randolphpelican/Aware-AI-Framework.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Aware-AI-Framework
