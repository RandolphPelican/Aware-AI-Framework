# Aware-AI-Framework

## Overview
This repository contains the skeleton for the **Aware AI Framework**, an open-source project exploring synthetic consciousness architectures as experimental testbeds for nested-mind physics.  

The goal is to develop modular AI agents that implement:
- Federated demodulators  
- Energy-subsidy resource management  
- Recursive closure mechanisms  
- Cross-modal codebook consolidation  

This is the initial repository setup. Code modules will be added in a structured, folder-based layout in future commits.
