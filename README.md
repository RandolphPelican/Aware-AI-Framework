## Overview
The Aware-AI-Framework is an experimental platform designed to explore the emergence of awareness in AI systems and its interaction with physical certainty dynamics. This repository contains the skeleton architecture for the project, including modular demodulators, codebook structures, and resource management systems.

## Features
- **Federated Demodulators:** Independent modules for sensory input and pattern recognition.
- **Energy-Subsidy Manager:** Controls computational resources according to update costs.
- **Codebook Consolidation:** Merges local subsystems into higher-order coherence.
- **Recursive Closure Architecture:** Enables self-referential awareness loops.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/randolphpelican/Aware-AI-Framework.git
Navigate to the project folder:

cd Aware-AI-Framework


Review the folder structure and individual modules.

Contributing

Each module is developed and validated individually.

Submit pull requests for new demodulator types, codebook enhancements, or experimental scripts.
